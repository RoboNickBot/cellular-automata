* Universe types are Stackable just like Direction types
It just occurred to me that there is really only one way to construct
new universes on top of others, and that if I generalize that in the
same way that dimension types are generalized, I could implement new
universes just by stating their type.

In fact, I have a hunch that universes aren't even their own thing;
they're totally defined by and can be uniquely identified by the
dimension type that is associated with them!

One change that seems necessary to make this work is a "base" universe
with just one dimension that sits under Sidewalk.  (Or maybe a
zero-dimensional base sits under that?)
